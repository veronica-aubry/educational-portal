## Description

_Tutor users can create multiple-choice quizzes by grade level and enter vocab lists to use in a synonym-matching game.  Student users take quizzes to earn points and customize their avatars._

_This project was made with C# in Visual Studio using AJAX, the Altervista Thesaurus API, InteractJs_ and Identity 3.

## SetUp/Installation Requirements

### Installation

## Known Bugs

The quiz structure was created so that the user could navigate away and have their answers saved, but this feature currently does not work properly; will allow user to answer the questions multiple times
